The student will be able to file for the three complaint categories i.e. missing marks, request for a remark, and wrong academic year allocation. The forms should be dynamically generated according to the student complaint category. The form should be submitted to the respective course lecturer and attached to the course code. For a remark complaint, a student should complete the process by attaching proof of payment. For the wrong academic year, a student should indicate what they know is right. For all the complaint categories, students should fill in their respective details for example student number, registration number, course code, course name, academic year, semester, course name, course lecture, and year of study. If the student complaining has a registration number of 17/U, the complaint form should go to the school/college registrar to which they are attached. When a student complains, the mark sheet and attendance sheet of the lecture are checked automatically to confirm their existence. The lecturer can upload a mark sheet/attendance sheet, resolve a complaint and notify the students about the complaint status in case the need arises. The HOD can upload a mark sheet/attendance sheet, Resolve a complaint since he is a lecturer as well. HOD also gets a monthly report about the complaints status. HOD assigns a lecturer for the remarking. The registrar resolves complaints of 17/U and below",
